        <h2 class="section-title">What is "Passive Voice" ?</h2>
        <p><strong>Passive Voice is a grammatical construction in which the subject of a sentence is acted upon by the verb, rather than performing the action. In other words, the focus is on the receiver of the action rather than the doer (the agent).</strong></p>
        <p><strong>In Passive Voice, the object of the action becomes the subject of the sentence, The verb often includes a form of "to be" (e.g., am, is, are, was ,were) combined with the past participle of the main verb.</strong></p>

        <h2 class="section-title">The Easy-Steps to help you understand well about the Passive Voice</h2>
            <p><strong>Understanding the "Passive Voice" becomes easier when you break it down into steps :</strong></p>
            <h3>1. Identify the Active Sentence Structure</h3>
            <p>
                <strong>
                    <p>Active sentences follow this pattern : Subject + Verb + Object</p>
                    <li>Example : "The teacher (subject) explains (verb) the lesson (object)."</li>
                </strong>
            </p>
            
            <h3>2. Switch to Passive Structure</h3>
            <p>
                <strong>
                    <p>In Passive Voice, the object of the Active sentence becomes the subject of the Passive sentence. The focus is on who or what is being acted upon.</p>
                    <li>Passive Structure : Subject  + Be (in correct tense) + Verb(3) + By + Agent</li>
                    <li>Example : "The lesson (subject) is (be) explained (verb3) by the teacher (by + agent)."</li>
                </strong>
            </p>

            <h3>3. Use the correct tense of the Verb "to be"</h3>
            <p>
                <strong>
                    The form of "to be" changes depending on the tense of the original sentence.
                    <li>Example (Present) : "The lesson <u>is</u> explained."</li>
                    <li>Example (Past) : " The lesson <u>was</u> explained."</li>
                    <li>Example (Future) : "The lesson <u>will be</u> explained."</li>
                </strong>
            </p>

            <h3>4. Optional : Mention the Agent (Who is doing the action)</h3>
            <p>
                <strong>
                    <p>In Passive Voice, the agent is often left out if it is not important or obvious.</p>
                    <li>Example : "The lession is explained by the teacher." You can omit "by the teacher" if it is clear from the context.</li>
                </strong>
            </p>

            <h3>5. Practice Converting Active Voice to Passive Voice</h3>
            <p>
                <strong>
                    <p>It is one of the best way to make us clear about the Passive Voice. For Example :</p>
                    <li>Active Voice tense : The chef cooked the meal.</li>
                    <li>Passive Voice tense : The meal was cooked by the chef.</li>
                </strong>
            </p>
        
            <h2 class="section-title">The Benefits that you gain from learning Passive Voice</h2>
            <p><strong>Learning and mastering the Passive Voice offers several benefits, especailly in communication and writing. Here are some key advantages :</strong></p>
            <h3>1. Focus on the action or result</h3>
            <p><strong>Passive Voice empasizes <u>what happened</u> or <u>the action itself</u>, rather than who performed it.</strong></p>
            <p><strong><li>Example : "The project was completed" focuses on the completion, which may be more important than who did it.</li></strong></p>
            
            <h3>2. Neutral and Objective tone</h3>
            <p><strong>It helps in maintaining a more <u>nuetral tone</u>, often used in formal writing like academic, scientific, and news reports to avoid pointing fingers.</strong></p>
            <p><strong><li>Example : "Mistakes were made." Rather than "You made mistakes."</li></strong></p>

            <h3>3. Useful when the agent is unknown or irrelevant</h3>
            <p><storng>In some cases, who performed the action is either unknown or unimportant.</storng></p>
            <p><strong><li>Example : "The window was broken." Rather than "We don't know who broke it, but the broken window is what matters."</li></strong></p>

            <h3>4. Politeness and tact</h3>
            <p><strong>Passive Voice can be a tool for being more polite or diplomatic by avoiding direct blame.</strong></p>
            <p><strong><li>Example : "Your application was not approved." Sound more polite than "We did not approve your application."</li></strong></p>

            <h3>5. Consistency in writing</h3>
            <p><strong>In research, technical, or formal writing, using passive voice ensures consistency, especially when describing processes or results.</strong></p>
            <p><strong><li>Example : "The experiment was conducted, and data eas analyzed."</li></strong></p>

            <h3>6.Enhances clarity and variety in writing</h3>
            <p><strong>In complex sentences, passive voice can improve clarity by simplifying the sentence structure and varying the sentence patterns.</strong></p>
            <p><strong><li>Example : "The song was written in 2005." Clearer than "Someone wrote the song in 2005."</li></strong></p>

            <p><strong>Understanding and applying passive voice allows for greater flexibility and precision in communication, depending on the context and what you want to emphasize.</strong></p>
