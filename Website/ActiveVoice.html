            <h2 class="section-title">The Easy-Steps to help you understand well about the Active Voice</h2>
                <p><h4><strong>Learning how to use the "Active Voice" in English is relatively simple once you understand its basic structure. Here are some easy steps to help you grasp it :</h4></strong></p>
                <h3>1. Understand the Basic Structure</h3>
                <p><strong>In "Active Voice" the subject does the action, while in the "Passive Voice" the subject receives the action. The Active Voice structure is :</strong></p>
                <li><strong>Subject (who does the action) + Verb (action) + Object (what receives the action)</strong></li>
                
                <h3>2. Recognize Common Verbs</h3>
                <p><strong>Practice identifying verbs, as tehy are the action words in the sentences. Once you recognize the verb, it's easier to see if the subject is actively doing something (Active Voice) or if something is being done to it (Passive Voice)</strong></p>

                <h3>3. Convert Passive to Active Voice</h3>
                <p><strong>When sentences are in the Passive Voice, try converting them into the Active Voice. For example :</strong></p>
                <li><strong>Passive Voice : The cake was eaten by John.</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Active Voice : John ate the cake.</strong></li>
                <p><strong>This will help reinforce the concept of active voice.</strong></p>

                <h3>4. Keep the Sentence Simple</h3>
                <p><strong>Use short, simple sentences to practice. Complicated sentences can be tricky when you are first learning, so focus on basic sentence structures like :</strong></p>
                <li><strong>He reads a book.</strong></li>
                <li><strong>She plays the piano.</strong></li>

                <h3>5. Check for Clarity and Directness</h3>
                <p><strong>The Active Voice is often more direct and engaging. When editing your sentences, ask yourself if the subject is clearly doing the action. If it's indirect, you may have written in Passive Voice.</strong></p>

                <h3>6. Practice with Everyday Examples</h3>
                <p><strong>Look at sentences from newspapers, books, or your own writing, and identify whether they are in the active voice. Rewrite any passive sentences into the active voice for extra practice.</strong></p>

                <h3>7. Practice Speaking in Active Voice</h3>
                <p><strong>When you are having conversations, challenge yourself to speak more directly by using the active voice. This will help reinforce the pattern in your mind.</strong></p>
                <p><strong>By using these methods regularly, you will become comfortable with identifying and using the active voice. Consistent practice is key!!</strong></p>
    
            <h2 class="section-title">The Benefits that you gain from learning the Active Voice</h2>
                <p><h4><strong>Leaning and using Active Voice in English offers many benefits, both in writing and speaking. Here are some key advantages :</strong></h4></p>
                <h3>1. Clarity and Directness</h3>
                <p><strong>Active Voice makes sentences clearer and more straightforward because the subject of the sentence is performing the action.</strong></p>
                <li><strong>For example : "She completed the project." is clearer than "The project was completed by her."</strong></li>
                <p><strong>The directness helps readers and listeners understand your message quickly.</strong></p>

                <h3>2. Improved Readability</h3>
                <p><strong>Active Voice sentences are typically shorter and easier to read.</strong></p>
                <li><strong>For example : "The manager approved the plan" (Active) VS "The plan was approved by the manager" (Passive)</strong></li>
                <p><strong>Shorter, simpler sentences make your writing more engaging and easier to follow.</strong></p>

                <h3>3. More Engaging and Dynamic</h3>
                <p><strong>Active Voice Makes your writing more interesting because it highlights the action and the doer. This creates a sense of movement and energy in your sentences.</strong></p>

                <h3>5. Fosters Reponsibility</h3>
                <p><strong>Active Voice assigns reponsibility to the subject. In situations where accountability is important (like business or law), active voice makes it clear who is reponsible for an action.</strong></p>
                <li><strong>For example : "John submitted the report" VS "The report was submitted". The first sentence clearly shows who is responsible for submitting the report.</strong></li>

                <h3>6. Encourage Action</h3>
                <p><strong>When giving instructions or motivating others, active voice is more compelling and action-oriented.</strong></p>
                <li><strong>For example : "Take the first step" is more inspiring than "The first step should be taken".</strong></li>

                <h3>7. Reduce Wordiness</h3>
                <p><strong>Active Voice usually requires fewer words than Passive Voice, helping to keep your writing concise and avoiding unnecessary complexity.</strong></p>
                <li><strong>For example : "The chef cooked the meal" (4 Words) VS "The meal was cooked by the chef" (6 Words).</strong></li>

                <h3>8. Better for Persuasive Writing</h3>
